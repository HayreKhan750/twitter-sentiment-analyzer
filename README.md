# 📊 Twitter Sentiment Analyzer

Welcome to the **Twitter Sentiment Analyzer** — an interactive and powerful app that lets you analyze the sentiment of any tweet or short text.  
Powered by **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **Naive Bayes** machine learning model, it predicts if your input is **Positive** 😊 or **Negative** 😞 with confidence scores and a clean, modern UI built with **Streamlit**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🐦 Analyze real-world tweets or any text input you want
- 🔍 Fast and reliable sentiment predictions using a trained Naive Bayes classifier
- 🧹 Automatic text cleaning: removes URLs, mentions, punctuation, and stopwords
- 📊 Displays sentiment with confidence percentage and visual feedback (balloons for positive!)
- 🎨 Sleek, responsive, and user-friendly Streamlit interface
- 🧑‍💻 Easy to customize and extend for other NLP tasks

Follow these steps to get started locally:

1️⃣ **Clone the repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HayreKhan750/twitter-sentiment-analyzer.git
cd Twitter-Sentiment-Analyzer
```

2️⃣ **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv env
# Windows
env\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate
```

3️⃣ **Install dependencies:**

```bash

## 📈 How It Works

1. You enter any tweet or short text in the input box.
2. The app preprocesses the text by cleaning (lowercasing, removing URLs, mentions, special characters, and stopwords).
3. The cleaned text is vectorized using a saved vectorizer.
4. The vector is fed into the pre-trained Naive Bayes model, which predicts the sentiment label (Positive or Negative).
5. The app displays the prediction and confidence score, along with an emoji and fun visual cues!
